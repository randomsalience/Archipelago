# Prodigal

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All items that appear on the collection screen, plus heart ores, normal keys, and gold pickups, are shuffled. All locations which contain such items are shuffled, including chests, NPCs, freestanding items, and heart ores. The Pick, Hand, and Knuckle are progressive. Buffs and items from the One Small Favor quest are not shuffled.

You can choose whether to shuffle certain locations, including the trading quest, hidden overworld items, drops from grelins, and locations in Daemon's Dive and Enlightenment.

The Specific Keys option replaces normal keys with keys specific to each dungeon. If this option is off, the game may require you to buy normal keys from Zaegul to make progress.

## What else is changed in the randomizer?

Several changes have been made to accommodate the randomization.
- The game starts in Act 2, meaning the portal to the Colorless Void is open, the sailor can take you to the Howling Bjerg, and so forth. Bolivar remains in town as he has an item.
- Siska's Workshop and the Backrooms are open from the start of the game.
- The menu contains a Warp button which takes you back to Pa's house.
- If Specific Keys is turned on, two new pages are added to the collection screen to show your key count for each dungeon.
- Extra checks are added on the bosses Yhorte, Siska, Inkwell, and Me?.
- The number of colors needed to enter the lighthouse, the number of blessings needed to obtain the Hero's Soul, the number of crest fragments needed for the door in Castle Vann, and the number of coins needed for the underwater door can be changed.
- The lighthouse door may be opened as soon as you have the required number of colors.
- Time Out 2 now opens at the same time as Time Out 1.
- You start out knowing the harmonica tune, meaning there is no need to do the Reflective Crypt.
- Tess will give you an item once you obtain the hairpin and any four pairs of boots.
- Crystal keys cannot be taken out of their dungeons.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the shuffled items may appear in another player's world.

## What does another world's item look like in Prodigal?

Currently freestanding items appear as their vanilla sprites, so you do not see what you are getting until you collect it.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

The item sprite appears above Oran's head and a dialogue box pops up telling you what item you obtained.
